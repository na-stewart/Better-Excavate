# Better-Excavate
Bexcavate is a program created for the computer craft mod in Minecraft. This program is utilized on a mining turtle to be able to excavate a large area efficiently. Bexcavate is an extension of the excavate command. However it is superior because you can specify the exact dimensions you want the bot to excavate. Bexcavate also can auto place torches to prevent the spawning of mobs.

Bexcavate is:
- Gravel proof
- Liquid proof
- Mob proof
